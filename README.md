An analysis of lead contamination in New York State public school drinking water.
# 🏫 NY Public School Lead Contamination Analysis

This project investigates lead contamination in drinking water across public schools in New York State. Using publicly available data and custom data analysis, we identify high-risk counties, evaluate school compliance with state regulations, assess remediation efforts, and propose targeted awareness campaigns to support public health and safety.

## 📊 Project Files

- `public_school_lead_data.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and key insights.
- `Public School Data Report.pdf`: Final report summarizing the findings, conclusions, and marketing strategy.

## 🧠 Key Insights

1. **High-Risk Counties**  
   - Identified the top 10 counties with the highest lead contamination levels (above 5 ppb).
   - Notably, 3 of the top 5 counties are located within New York City.

2. **Compliance Analysis**  
   - Approximately 92% of schools are compliant with mandatory testing.
   - 8% remain unapproved or untested, posing health risks.

3. **Remediation Status**  
   - Many schools are in ongoing or incomplete remediation phases.
   - Opportunities exist for offering retesting and long-term monitoring solutions.

## 🎯 Marketing Strategy Recommendations

- **Targeted Outreach**: Focus campaigns in high-risk counties and districts with older housing infrastructure.
- **Community Engagement**: Partner with local orgs and provide multilingual education materials.
- **Digital Awareness**: Run geo-targeted ads and share testing success stories.

## 🔍 Data Source

## ✅ Future Work

- Deeper geospatial analysis to detect hyper-local risk areas.
- Correlation analysis between school lead levels and neighborhood housing conditions.
- Expansion of public health initiatives based on findings.
